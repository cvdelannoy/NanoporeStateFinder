Title: A package for nanopore trace analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Carlos de Lannoy
Maintainer: Carlos de Lannoy <cvdelannoy@gmail.com>
Description:Analyze nanopore recordings directly from abf-files. Allows filtering of white noise from the data and
    automated recognition of events (i.e. uninterrupted periods during which current remains in a certain state)
    using hidden markov models. Lastly, provides plotting functions for abfData objects, allowing insight in
    dwell times, and current levels during events. The provided R Shiny visual User Interface may provide improved
    ease of use to both novices and more experienced R-users.
    Developed at and for the Maglia lab of Groningen University, The Netherlands.
Note:
    This package is in an early state of development. Use with caution.
    Build mainly around the Hidden Markov Models provided by the DepmixS4-package.
    Future additions will include:
    - Examples for the application of all methods
    - The option to set a lower limit for state duration
    - Loading previously determined HMM parameters
